## Hate Crimes

A hate crime is a type of violent act that is motivated by a particular bias, in this case, it would be Asian descent. According to data collected by the FBI and interpreted by [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/03/25/asian-hate-crime-fbi-black-lgbtq), a nonprofit journalism organization that participates in the coverage of criminal justice, crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders saw the highest increases from 2020 to 2021. With an increase of 167% and with cases jumping from 279 in 2020 to 746 in 2021, it is quite clear that a large majority of this sharp increase was caused by the pandemic.

## Specific Cases

Over the past 3 years, there have been numerous tragic displays of anti-Asian violence across America. This blog post will be going over just two of them.

- Yao Pan Ma
> Yao Pan Ma, age 61, was collecting cans on the sidewalk in East Harlem on April 23rd, 2021. While he was collecting cans, a 49-year-old African American man, later identified as Jarrod Powell, shoved Ma to the ground and repeatedly kicked him in the head. Over the next 8 months, Ma was in and out of different hospitals and facilities until on December 31st, 2021 he passed away because of his head injuries.

- Michelle Alyssa Go
>  Michelle Alyssa Go, age 40, was waiting for her train at the Times Square-42nd Street station on January 15th, 2022, when she was pushed onto the tracks and in front of an oncoming train, resulting in her untimely death. The perpetrator was identified as a 61-year-old homeless man, Martial Simon. Because of the incident's unprovoked nature, it was speculated to be because of her Chinese descent.

## Conclusion

To summarize, the COVID-19 pandemic was the spark that lit the fire of xenophobia and biases in the United States. Over the past 3 years, we have seen a sharp increase in anti-Asian violence. On the other hand, there has also been a sharp increase in support of Asian Americans to stand up to said violence and hate crimes.
